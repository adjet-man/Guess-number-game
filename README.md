# Introdction 
The code generates two random numbers between 1 and 100 and randomly selects an arithmetic operation from addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 
# • It then prompts the user to guess the result of the operation. 
# • If the user's guess is correct, it prints a congratulatory message and exits the program. 
# • If the user's guess is incorrect, it prompts them to guess again until they get it right. 
# • The updated version of the code also includes error handling for cin input to avoid unexpected behavior in case of non-integer input. 

# Conlusion
Overall, this code is a simple example of a guessing game that demonstrates basic concepts such as random number generation, arithmetic operations, and input/output using cin and cout.
